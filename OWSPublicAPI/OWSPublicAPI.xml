            <summary>
            Creates a new Character.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Create a new Character and attach it to the User referenced by the UserSessionGUID. ClassName is the name of the Class you setup in the management console (from the Characters tab). 
            Classes are meant to be default values for creating characters. The purpose is to ensure that players are not able to hack their starting stats. This is needed because Characters are created from and unsecure UE4 client
            that has not connected to a UE4 server yet.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Get the Zone Server to travel to based on the User referenced by the UserSessionGUID. Send in an empty ZoneName or ZoneName set to "GETLASTZONENAME" to use the last zone the Character was on rather than specifying a ZoneName.
